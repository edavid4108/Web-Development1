            <h4>The  Willie & Vivian Gaddis Foundation for K.I.D.S. is a non profit organization with
                the intent to empower and equip others to discover and pursue their purpose, especially children. With the wisdom and a vision from co-founder Alethea Gaddis, they have a program called Jump Start U4
                College, which gives 9th - 12 grade students the opportunity to visit various colleges within the United States. In addiiotn they conduct workshops
                which talks about finacial aid, schoalrships, college life, living within a budget, and other important items that will enhance high school kids.
                They approached The EdWeb to have a remake of their website, and well as creating ads to promote their Jump Start U4 College tour (and their various)
                workshops that accomodare the tour). Without a thought, we were up to the task.

            <p>The biggest challege was just figuring out a WordPress theme to use for the organization. In additon there was some 
                modifications to the lgog so that the wording would not clash with other colors in the background where necessary 
                (in other words having a white box within a black box, like you may see onother web pages). Something 
                fundametal like this can go a long way.

            <h3>Okay Now We're (REALLY) Ready</h3>
            <p>As mentioend before, the Gaddis 4 K.I.D.S. website was for the most part straight forward. Yes it did take close to a month to complete
                becuase of not only all the content that had to be rearranged, but also content had to be edited. In addition visitors were busy parents,  so the old 
                layout could not be transfered due to the time it takes to find infomration. So instead of bombarding them with inforamtion on the homepage
                it was presented simple and clear what they needed. Finally there were A LOT of images that had to be resized and edited to make them stand out. Finally the creation of
                online forms was requested for variuious applications needed for the students. These forms of course were tied to a back end database for collection.
                This made registering students so much easier! Overall the project was considered to be a success.

            <p>Finally, as a bonus, various ads were created to promote not only the college tour, but also the workshops that accomodated the tour via Facebook 
                and Instagram. Again, noting too fancy, marketed to busy parents.
